                    <h2>About Me</h2>

                    <p>I learned to mix music when I was 13, and since then I have felt connected to every sound, every
                        rhythm, and every song. I have participated in several events, and my biggest dream is to play
                        my
                        own songs at Tomorrowland.</p>

                            <strong>Who Dj Alow is?</strong>
                            <p>I was born in Oaxaca on April 10, 2001, in a house where music always seemed to find a
                                way to slip into the days. When I was 13, my father took me by the hand and taught me
                                how to use a turntable. I remember the feel of the records, the vibration of the bass
                                traveling through the room, and that electric feeling of discovering that, with my
                                hands, I could stir emotions. That's where it all began: reggaeton lit the spark,
                                electronic music opened my horizons, pop taught me melodies, alternative rock gave me
                                identity, and hard techno fueled my audacity.
                                In 2016, I created my first song. I didn't release it right away; it was like a secret
                                that still needed to mature. But I took it with me to different events and, to my
                                surprise, people began to resonate with it. There was something about that sound, a
                                mixture of my roots and my dreams, that connected. That small triumph ignited a bigger
                                flame: I understood that I couldn't stay in my comfort zone.
                                So I decided to move forward. I created more songs, each one like a piece of my story. I
                                created my website, a space where I could exist as I was, without masks. I started
                                traveling to different places, sharing my music and my essence. And along the way, I
                                also discovered different versions of myself: first Dj Junco, then Dj Junidrops,
                                identities that helped me explore who I could become. Each name taught me something,
                                pushed me forward, opened doors for me.
                                Finally, between beats, mistakes, successes, and lessons learned, the name that I truly
                                felt was mine was born: DJ Alow. It not only represented my sound, but also the
                                evolution of a child who one day spun a record out of curiosity and ended up finding a
                                passion that would change everything.
                                Today, I continue to create, dreaming with my feet on the ground but my eyes on the sky,
                                always remembering that each mix is one more step toward the best version of myself.</p>
